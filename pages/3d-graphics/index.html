                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>This is a guide for creating basic 3D graphs in Desmos. You'll explore several techniques for creating 3D graphs, starting with a minimal implementation for a 3D graph, which will progressively gain more features until you've created an entire graphics pipeline within Desmos. Some experience with linear algebra is recommended but is by no means required. Programming experience is unnecessary, but will be helpful if you plan to import 3D meshes into Desmos.</p>
                <h2>A minimal 3D graph</h2>
                <h3>Defining our Data</h3>
                <p>Let's start by making a very simple graph that looks 3D. To make this simple for us, we'll make our graph show us the eight vertices of a cube. The cube will have a side length of one unit. Here are the locations of its vertices:</p>
                <img class="right-image" src="cube-vertices.png">
                <ul>
                    <li>(0, 0, 0)</li>
                    <li>(0, 0, 0)</li>
                    <li>(0, 1, 1)</li>
                    <li>(0, 1, 0)</li>
                    <li>(1, 0, 1)</li>
                    <li>(1, 0, 1)</li>
                    <li>(1, 1, 0)</li>
                    <li>(1, 1, 1)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>As Desmos does not support 3D points, we'll have to represent these points in three different lists. The first list represents the x-coordinates of the eight vertices, the second list represents the y-coordinates of the eight vertices, and the third list represents the z-coordinates of the eight vertices. Can you see how the list of vertices on the left and the lists on the right show the same data?</p>
                <img class="left-image" src="camera-position.png">
                <p>In addition to defining the vertices of our cube, we need to define the position of the camera&mdash; in other words, the position in the world from which we'll be viewing the cube. We'll start the camera at the position (0.25, 0.25, -1). I've made the Z-position negative so that the camera will be <em>behind</em> the cube (remember, its lowest z-value is 0, so our camera needs to have a z-value below that). That way, we'll be able to see it.</p>
                <h3>Projection</h3>
                <p>At this point, we've defined all the data we need in order to draw something on the screen. However, Desmos has no idea what to do with this data, because it only works in 2D. We need to define some way of converting this 3D data into a 2D format that Desmos can then draw to your screen. This process of converting 3D to 2D is called <em>projection</em>. Let's create a function, called "p<sub>roject</sub>," that takes a 3D point (x, y, z) as input, and produces a 2D point as output representing where that 3D point should appear on the screen.</p>
                <p>The nice thing is that projection is much simpler than you might think. After all, when we view things in 3D with our eyes, we're basically just viewing the world in 2D, except objects farther away in the Z-axis (depth) appear closer to the center of our field of view. This behavior can be accurately modeled by dividing the x- and y-positions by the z-position of a point. As such, our projection function outputs the 2D point (x / z, y / z).</p>

                <h3>Putting it All Together</h3>
                <p>There's one final step we have to do: We need to actually project our points. A Desmos function that normally only takes numbers&mdash; like our projection function&dash; can also operate on lists, one element at a time. However, if we just tried to directly plug our vertex position lists into the projection function, it wouldn't work properly, because we wouldn't be taking the camera's position into account.</p>
                <p>However, we can't directly move the camera. Instead, we have to do something rather strange. Consider how if you're moving forward, it appears as if the entire world around you is moving backward. If you move right, it appears that the entire world is moving to its left. We can do the same thing here&mdash; rather than "moving the camera," we move the world to the opposite position <em>as if</em> the camera was moving. As a consequence, before we project the 3D points, we have to subtract the camera's position from them. It might seem strange to subtract a number from a list. In this case, Desmos just applies the same operation to every element of the list separately. With all that said and done, here's the expression that actually moves the points to take the camera into account, and then projects them onto the screen.</p>

                <h3>The Completed Graph</h3>
                <p>With all that done, we now have a simple 3D graph that shows the vertices of a cube. Here's a completed version below. Try moving the sliders around to adjust the perspective:</p>
