                <h2>What is this site?</h2>
                <p><a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator">Desmos Graphing Calculator</a> is a web-based graphing calculator packed with interesting features that allow users to make all sorts of fascinating things. However, Desmos's <a href="https://help.desmos.com/hc/en-us/articles/4406040715149-Getting-Started-Desmos-Graphing-Calculator">official documentation</a>&mdash; while sufficient for most users&mdash; does not completely do Desmos justice, as it does not cover many of the tool's more obscure features and techniques. This site was created to remedy that, providing a deep dive into many Desmos features and techniques of which users might be unaware.</p>
