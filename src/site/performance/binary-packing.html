                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>Sometimes, in Desmos, you have to store and/or update a large amount of data. Sometimes, Desmos doesn't want to handle that much data. For instance, what if you want to store 20000 numbers in a single expression? Sometimes, Desmos can handle that much data, but can't update it quickly. For instance, what if you wanted to modify a 5000-element list with an action?</p>
                <h2>The Solution</h2>
                <p>Surprisingly, there often is a way to get around these issues in Desmos: Binary packing, the art of storing multiple numbers inside of one number. With it, we can store lists more than 10000 elements long and copy around massive amounts of data at lightning speed. How does it work?</p>
                <h2>Binary Numbers</h2>
                <p>Feel free to skip this section if you already know how binary numbers work.</p>
                <p>At some point in school you probably learned about the place-value system. This is how the numbers you're familiar with work: For instance, the number 8192 is equal to 8000 + 100 + 90 + 2, which is equal to 8*10^3 + 1*10^2 + 9*10^1 + 2*10^0. Each digit represents a number ten times as large as the one after it. Because of this, we don't have digits greater than 9, because then we could have two numbers that look different but represent the same numerical value. For instance, if we made a digit "A" equal to 10, then "10" and "A" would be the same thing. So digits are capped at 9 to allow us to represent all numbers without duplicates.</p>
                <p>To recap, 8192 = 8000 + 100 + 90 + 2 = 8*10^3 + 1*10^2 + 9*10^1 + 2*10^0. However, why do we have to have each number be multiplied to a power of ten? What if we had each number be multiplied by a power of two instead? If we did this, we would only need the digits 0 and 1, because anything greater would create that same redundancy issue discussed later.</p>
                <p>Let's look at the number 11010. With our new number system, this would be equal to 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0, which is equal to 16 + 8 + 0 + 2 + 0, which is equal to 26.</p>
                <p>This numbering system is called "binary" or "base two," and is the numbering system used inside of computers, and&mdash; consequently&mdash; inside of Desmos internally. Nearly every decimal (base ten) number you see in Desmos corresponds to some binary number in your computer's memory.</p>
                <p>Let's introduce some terminology.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A "bit" (short for "binary digit") is a single digit in binary. It can either be a 0 or a 1.</li>
                    <li>A "byte" is eight bits.</li>
                    <li>An "n-bit binary number" is a binary number composed of n bits. For instance, a 6-bit binary number is six bits long. An n-bit binary number&mdash; ignoring negative numbers for now&mdash; can store a number from 0 to 2^n - 1 inclusive. So a 6-bit binary number can store numbers from 0 to 2^6-1, or from 0 to 63.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Floating-point Binary Numbers</h2>
                <p>Feel free to skip this section if you already know how floats/doubles work.</p>
                <p>All numbers in Desmos are what are called IEEE-754 Double-precision floating-point numbers. That's a big mouthful. Let's break it down somewhat.</p>
                <p>"IEEE-754" is just a standard that defines how floating-point numbers should work to ensure interoperability.</p>
                <p>"Double-precision" refers to how much data the numbers should store: 64 bits in this case. "Single-precision" is 32 bits, so, naturally, "double-precision" is 64 bits.</p>
                <p>"Floating-point number" describes how the number is stored in memory. These kinds of numbers are made up of three parts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>52 mantissa/significand bits. These store a binary number.</li>
                    <li>11 exponent bits. These bits are an 11-bit binary number that determines where the decimal point (which would actually be called a "binary point" in this case) lies within the mantissa/significand. Changing the exponent bits' number by 1 would shift the binary point over by one place, multiplying or dividing the resulting number by two.</li>
                    <li>A sign bit, which is 1 if the number is negative or 0 if the number is positive.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Note that the sizes of the mantissa and exponent can be different for different floating-point formats. The sizes above are for double-precision specifically, because that is what Desmos uses.</p>
                <h2>So... what's the point of all this?</h2>
                <p>At this point, you may have already guessed what we're going to do: We're going to store multiple numbers inside of one number, taking advantage of our knowledge of Desmos's internal format to store as much data as reasonably possible.</p>
                <p>For instance, let's say you want to store a list of <em>over 10000</em> integers that range in size from 0 to 5000. We can store those numbers in a 13-bit format because 13-bit numbers can store numbers from 0 to 2^13-1 = 8191. We couldn't use 12-bit numbers, on the other hand, because those only go up to 2^12-1 = 4095. We can theoretically store four of those in a single Desmos number, because four of them takes 13*4=52 of the 64 bits, while five of them takes 13*5 = 65, which is more than the 64 bits available. Consequently, we can store a list of up to 40000 of these numbers in a single expression.</p>
                <h3>Storing Numbers</h3>
                <p>To actually store them, we can get away with only using the 52-bit mantissa, which simplifies things greatly. I won't go over dealing with the exponent, which complicates things somewhat. Let's call the numbers we're trying to store <code>n1</code>, <code>n2</code>, <code>n3</code>, and <code>n4</code>. We can create a function <code>store</code> that returns the packed Desmos number containing these four numbers, and create another funtion <code>retrieve</code> that retrieves the <code>i</code>th number from the <code>packed</code> number.</p>
                <p>To implement the <code>store</code> function, we have to consider how these numbers are being stored. The first number&mdash; <code>n1</code>&mdash; occupies the first 13 bytes&mdash; i.e. the 2^0th through 2^12ths place of the packed number's mantissa. <code>n2</code> occupies the next 13 bytes&mdash; the 2^13ths through 2^25ths place. <code>n3</code> occupies the 2^26ths throguh 2^38ths, and <code>n4</code> occupies the 2^39ths through 2^51st place.</p>
                <p>As a consequence of this, we can store <code>n1</code> directly. We can then store <code>n2</code> by first multiplying it by 2^13 (so that its 2^0ths place becomes the final number's 2^13ths place, etc.) and adding it to the final number. We can then store <code>n3</code> the same way, but we multiply by 2^26. For <code>n4</code>, multiply by 2^39. Our final <code>store</code> function is as follows:</p>
                <code>store(n1, n2, n3, n4) = n1 + 2^13*n2 + 2^26*n3 + 2^39*n4</code>
                <h3>Retrieving Numbers</h3>
                <p>To retrieve numbers, we effectively have to reverse this operation. Getting <code>n1</code> is arguably the simplest: We can simply take <code>mod(packed, 2^13)</code>. This is effectively like dividing the number by 2^13 and taking the remainder. Every power of two greater than 2^12 divides 2^13 evenly, so they will not factor into the final calculation, leaving the 2^0ths through 2^12ths place as the final number. This is exactly how we stored <code>n1</code> above.</p>
                <p>Retrieving <code>n2</code> is slightly more complicated. <code>n2</code> is currently multiplied by 2^13 within the packed number. Thus, to retrieve it, we first need to divide <code>packed</code> by 2^13. However, this also makes <code>n1</code> become a fractional part of <code>packed/2^13</code>. We fix this by rounding down with the <code>floor</code> operation, giving us <code>floor(packed/2^13)</code>. This leaves us with the contributions from <code>n3</code> and <code>n4</code>, which we also need to eliminate. This can be fixed with mod 2^13 yet again, since now those two numbers occupy the 2^13th through 2^38th place (as they've been "shifted" 13 bits down via the division by 2^13). This gives us a final expression of <code>mod(floor(packed/2^13), 2^13)</code></p>
                <p>To get <code>n3</code>, the process is extremely similar: We divide by 2^26 this time to make <code>n3</code> take up the 13 least significant integer bits, take the floor to get rid of the fractional portion, and do mod 2^13 to get rid of <code>n4</code>. Our final expression is <code>mod(floor(packed/2^26), 2^13)</code></p>
                <p>To get <code>n4</code>, the process is once again quite similar. As you might have guessed at this point, we divide by 2^39 to get <code>mod(floor(packed/2^39), 2^13)</code>. We wouldn't necessarily need to do the mod in this case (there are no more significant numbers), giving us <code>floor(packed/2^39)</code>. However, I did include it for a reason.</p>
                <p>Notice the pattern here? We can represent this generally with the formula <code>mod(floor(packed/2^(13i)), 2^13)</code>, where <code>i</code> determines which number we're retrieving&mdash; 0 for <code>n1</code>, 1 for <code>n2</code>, 2 for <code>n3</code>, and 3 for <code>n4</code>.</p>
                <h3>Formulas for Storing and Retrieving:</h3>
                <code>store(n1, n2, n3, n4) = n1 + 2^13*n2 + 2^26*n3 + 2^39*n4</code>
                <br>
                <code>retrieve(packed, i) = mod(floor(packed/2^(13i)), 2^13)</code>
                <p>See <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/o6yxkkngst">this example</a> to see these formulas in action.</p>
                <h2>Generalizing the algorithm</h2>
                <p>This can be extended to beyond just 13-bit numbers. Similar techniques can be applied to numbers of any size. You can store negative numbers in a "biased form," e.g. to store numbers from -500 to 500, you could add 500 to each number before storing, and subtract 500 after retrieving. You can even store fractional portions of numbers&mdash; for instance, you could store 16ths of a number by multiplying by 16 and flooring prior to storing; and dividing by 16 after retrieving. If you're feeling particularly crazy, you can even create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minifloat">your own smaller floating-point formats</a>.</p>
                <h2>Possible Use Cases</h2>
                <p>There are a few possible use cases for this technique. One very useful case is updating large amounts of data with actions performantly. Updating a large list with an action incurs a significant performance penalty. <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/eqafyaphp7">This graph</a>, for instance, has to modify a grid of 1000 squares with an action, which can either be light or dark. This is sped up by noticing that&mdash; since each square has two possible states&mdash; each square only requires a single bit. To simplify things, I only used 50 bits per number (out of a theoretical 64), but this still allowed me to put 1000 squares in a list only 20 elements long.</p>
                <p>Another use case is placing more than 10000 elements into a list when elements are small. I used this for <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/l7nehb64nz">Desmos Plane</a> to help reduce expression count. A large number of expressions causes lag for unknown reasons, making this optimization very useful.</p>
