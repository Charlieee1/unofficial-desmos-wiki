Making something 3D in Desmos may initially seem like a daunting task. However, it's ultimately far simpler than it looks once you break it down. This guide will explain how Desmos 3D works and how one can implement their own 3D engine. The focus will be on readability rather than achieving maximum performance.

## What are 3D Scenes Made Of?

Before diving into making an actual 3D engine, it's important to consider what 3D scenes are actually made of. 3D scenes are usually made up of 3D _meshes_. 3D meshes are nothing more than a group of many, many triangles in 3D space. These triangles are themselves made up of the following components:

1. A collection of 3D {% latex "\\left(x, y, z\\right)" %} points, where each point is called a _vertex_. Keep in mind that these will have to be split into three lists (a list of x-values, a list of y-values, and a list of z-values), because Desmos currently does not support 3D points.
2. A collection of numbers that determine _which_ points make up the vertices of _which_ triangles. For instance, these may say that a triangle in a mesh is formed from the 3rd, 4th, and 7th vertex. These numbers are called _indices_.
